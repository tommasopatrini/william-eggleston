                <p class="about-paragraph about-paragraph-1">Over the course of nearly six decades, William Eggleston (b. 1939) has established a singular pictorial style that deftly combines vernacular subject matter with an innate and sophisticated understanding of color, form, and composition. His photographs transform the ordinary into distinctive, poetic images that eschew fixed meaning. His 1976 solo exhibition at The Museum of Modern Art, New York, curated by John Szarkowski, marked one of the first presentations of color photography at the museum. Although initially criticized for its unfamiliar approach, the show and its accompanying catalogue, William Eggleston's Guide, heralded an important moment in the medium's acceptance within the art-historical canon, and it solidified the artist's position as one of its foremost practitioners to this date. Eggleston's work continues to exert an influence on contemporary visual culture at large.</p>
                <p class="about-paragraph about-paragraph-2">Eggleston was born in Memphis, Tennessee, where he continues to live today. Raised in Sumner, Mississippi, he attended Vanderbilt University, Nashville; Delta State College, Cleveland, Mississippi; and University of Mississippi, Oxford. In 2016, the artist joined David Zwirner. William Eggleston: The Democratic Forest, an exhibition of works drawn from the artist’s encyclopedic project, marked his first gallery solo show at the gallery’s New York location. William Eggleston: 2 1/4 was on view in 2019 at David Zwirner London. In 2020, an exhibition at the gallery's Hong Kong location marked the artist's debut solo presentation in Greater China. The two-person exhibition, William Eggleston and John McCracken: True Stories, was on view at David Zwirner New York in 2021. William Eggleston: The Outlands was presented in 2022 at the gallery's 19th Street location in New York. In 2024, William Eggleston: The Last Dyes opened at David Zwirner Los Angeles. The presentation was on view through the beginning of 2025, and will travel to David Zwirner New York in 2026.</p>
